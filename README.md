## 🛠 Installation Guide

You can download the latest version of FileOrganizer from the **Releases** page:

👉 https://github.com/achyutb02/FileOrganizerApp/releases/latest

Inside the release, you'll find:

- **FileOrganizer_Ready_To_Use_MAC.zip**
- **FileOrganizer_Ready_To_Use_Windows.zip**

---

## 🍎 macOS Installation

macOS blocks apps that are not from the App Store or a verified developer.  
So the first launch requires a small workaround.

### **How to open the app on macOS:**

1. Download and unzip **FileOrganizer_Ready_To_Use_MAC.zip**
2. Move `FileOrganizer.app` into your **Applications** folder (recommended)
3. Right-click the app → **Open**
4. macOS will show a security popup → click **Open**

After the first time, you can open it normally.

> 🔒 *Why?*  
> Because this app isn't signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate (yet).  
> macOS requires this right-click bypass for unsigned apps.

## 🪟 Windows Installation

Windows SmartScreen may show a warning, but the app is safe.

### **How to run on Windows:**

1. Download and unzip **FileOrganizer_Ready_To_Use_Windows.zip**
2. Double-click `FileOrganizer.exe`
3. If Windows SmartScreen appears:
   - Click **More info**
   - Click **Run anyway**

This only happens the first time—after that it opens normally.
