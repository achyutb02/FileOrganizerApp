## 🍎 macOS Installation

Since this app is not signed by an identified developer, macOS will initially block it. You need to approve it in your System Settings.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Download** and unzip the `FileOrganizer_Ready_To_Use_MAC.zip` file.
2.  Move the `FileOrganizer` app to your **Applications** folder.
3.  **Right-click** the app and select **Open**.
    * *You will see a warning saying it can't be opened.* Click **Done** or **Cancel**.
4.  Open your Mac's **System Settings** (or System Preferences).
5.  Go to **Privacy & Security** (usually on the left sidebar).
6.  Scroll down to the **Security** section.
    * You should see a message: *"FileOrganizer was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."*
7.  Click the **Open Anyway** button.
8.  Enter your password if prompted, and then click **Open** on the final confirmation.

**Note:** You only need to do this once. The app will open normally from now on.

> 🔒 *Why?*  
> Because this app isn't signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate (yet).  
> macOS requires this right-click bypass for unsigned apps.

2. Double-click `FileOrganizer.exe`
3. If Windows SmartScreen appears:

This only happens the first time—after that it opens normally.
